The Digital Vernier Caliper is essential for archaeological illustrations that require accurate measurements. With its digital readout, this tool enables precision measurements that can be recorded directly in millimetres or inches, making it versatile for a range of artefact sizes. The caliperâ€™s jaws are designed to measure both inside and outside dimensions, and the depth gauge is perfect for items with cavities. Ideal for documenting artefacts, the Digital Vernier Caliper supports both fieldwork and laboratory settings with reliable, repeatable measurements.
