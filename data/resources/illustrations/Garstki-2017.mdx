## Abstract

In this article, Kelsey Garstki explores the creation and use of 3D digital artifacts in archaeological research. Published in the _Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory_, the article delves into the processes behind 3D modeling and digital reproduction, discussing how virtual representations of artifacts contribute to both research and public engagement. Garstki examines the role of 3D technologies in enhancing archaeological practice, offering insights into the opportunities and challenges posed by digital artifact production.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at archaeologists, cultural heritage professionals, and digital humanities scholars interested in the production and use of 3D digital artifacts. It provides a comprehensive overview of how virtual representations can enhance research, interpretation, and preservation efforts in archaeology.
