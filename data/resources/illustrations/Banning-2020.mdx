## Abstract

In the chapter "Archaeological Illustration and Publication", E.B. Banning explores the conventions, technical skills, and equipment used in creating archaeological illustrations. Banning discusses how illustration serves as more than just a means of documenting artefacts; it is a vital part of interpretation, making certain features visible and aiding in classification. The chapter covers traditional and digital methods, the importance of standardised styles, and the roles of various technical conventions, such as shading and line thickness, that enhance accuracy and consistency. Banning’s insights emphasise illustration as a necessary skill for archaeologists, even with advances in digital imaging.

## Purpose and Audience

This chapter targets students, field archaeologists, and visual documentation specialists, focusing on practical guidelines and the historical evolution of archaeological illustration. Its in-depth discussion of conventions and techniques makes it ideal for those looking to refine their skills in artefact and stratigraphy illustration.

## Table of Contents

- Introduction to Archaeological Illustration
- Historical Development of Visual Conventions
- Basic Equipment and Tools
- Style and Representation in Archaeological Illustrations
- Technical Conventions and Standards
- Digital Illustration Methods
- Lithic and Pottery Drawing Techniques
- Challenges in Publication and Visual Consistency

## Key Excerpt

“Archaeological illustrations are not just pictures. They involve a formal graphical information language that omits certain details while highlighting others, providing a standardised way to describe and interpret artefacts and contexts” (p. 349)

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate. Banning’s chapter includes both practical advice and theoretical elements, requiring familiarity with archaeological concepts, yet accessible for those with some illustration experience.

## Practicality/Field Relevance

The chapter is highly practical, covering the essentials of archaeological illustration tools, conventions, and styles that archaeologists must employ to ensure consistent documentation and publication. It includes useful advice on integrating both hand-drawn and digital illustrations.

## Benefits of the Resource

This resource stands out for its comprehensive treatment of archaeological illustration, discussing both traditional and modern approaches. Banning emphasises accuracy and consistency, guiding readers through the steps of creating high-quality illustrations that meet publication standards. The advice on layout and style is invaluable for those preparing work for academic publication.

## Limitations of the Resource

While thorough, the chapter is largely focused on Western practices and lacks specific case studies or examples of non-Western visualisation traditions. Additionally, the balance between theoretical and practical aspects may be challenging for beginners without prior illustration training.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The chapter includes several illustrative examples, such as standard techniques for lithic and pottery drawing, but does not contain specific exercises. Examples of stylistic conventions and orientation guidelines serve as practical references.

## Reviews

This work has been well received for its insightful analysis of the role of illustration in archaeology, with particular praise for its exploration of technical conventions and the evolution of visual standards. Scholars appreciate its detailed guidance, essential for both students and professionals.
