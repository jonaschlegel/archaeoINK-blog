## Key Excerpt

“The main reasons why pottery is depicted using line illustration are still valid... A drawing can supply far more information in a much more immediate manner than a written description.” (p. 3)

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate. The guide covers foundational techniques and terminology, making it accessible to newcomers, but also includes technical details valuable to experienced illustrators.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This guide is highly relevant for field archaeologists and illustrators, covering core methods of pottery illustration while addressing the integration of traditional and digital techniques. It is a practical tool for those aiming to standardise their illustration processes in line with CIfA guidelines.

## Benefits of the Resource

The guide’s step-by-step explanations and emphasis on accuracy and standardisation make it a valuable reference. Its detailed focus on technical processes, from initial measurements to digital finalisation, allows readers to create publication-ready illustrations that enhance archaeological reports.

## Limitations of the Resource

While thorough for pottery illustration, the guide does not address broader illustration contexts, such as site maps or other artefact types. Additionally, the digital methods introduced are foundational and do not explore more advanced digital drawing software.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

Each section includes practical steps for illustrating pottery, but there are no formal exercises or case studies. Instructions on measuring and drawing are highly detailed, effectively guiding readers through the illustration process.

## Reviews

The guide is widely regarded within the archaeological community, particularly in the UK, for its adherence to CIfA standards and its structured approach to pottery illustration.
