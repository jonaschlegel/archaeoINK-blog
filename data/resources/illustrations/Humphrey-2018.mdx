## Key Excerpt

“It is the continual scrupulous cross-referencing that enables the botanical and scientific illustrator to deliver the most precise artworks, which arguably makes illustrations at times a more valuable source of information than photographs” (p. 12)

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

Humphrey’s book is an invaluable resource for illustrators in botanical and scientific fields. It offers clear, systematic instruction on technical aspects of illustration and places strong emphasis on developing observational skills. The inclusion of historical and theoretical background also makes it an enriching reference for understanding the broader scope of botanical art.
