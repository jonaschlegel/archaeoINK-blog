## Abstract

This paper, presented at the EuroMed 2018 conference, explores the digital reconstruction and restoration techniques applied to lace porcelain, a delicate and intricate ceramic material. Authored by Laurens Acke and colleagues, the paper details how modern 3D modeling and digital reconstruction technologies can be used to restore and preserve lace porcelain artifacts. The interdisciplinary study combines art restoration, cultural heritage, and digital technologies to offer new methodologies for the conservation of fragile historical objects.

## Purpose and Audience

This conference paper is aimed at researchers, conservators, and digital archaeologists interested in the application of digital reconstruction techniques in the field of cultural heritage preservation. It provides insights into how advanced 3D modeling can aid in the restoration and visualization of delicate porcelain artifacts.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction to Lace Porcelain and Its Challenges in Restoration
2. Digital Reconstruction Techniques for Fragile Materials
3. Case Studies: Restoring Lace Porcelain Using 3D Modeling
4. Discussion: Benefits and Limitations of Digital Reconstruction
5. Conclusion: Future Applications in Cultural Heritage Conservation

## Key Excerpt

"Digital reconstruction offers an innovative approach to preserving fragile historical objects such as lace porcelain. By creating detailed 3D models, conservators can visualize and reconstruct missing or damaged parts without physically manipulating the object, ensuring its long-term preservation."

## Reviews

This paper provides an excellent overview of the use of 3D modeling in cultural heritage preservation, demonstrating how digital techniques can revolutionize the restoration of fragile materials.
