## Abstract

In this article, Colleen Morgan and Holly Wright examine the integration of traditional drawing techniques and digital media in archaeological field recording. Published in the _Journal of Field Archaeology_, the paper discusses how the use of pencils (traditional drawing) and pixels (digital media) can complement each other in documenting archaeological sites. The authors evaluate the advantages and limitations of both methods and provide case studies illustrating their application in modern archaeological practice.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at archaeologists, illustrators, and digital humanists interested in the evolving methodologies of archaeological field recording. It is particularly relevant for those looking to understand the benefits and challenges of integrating traditional and digital media in archaeological documentation.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: Drawing and Digital Media in Archaeology
