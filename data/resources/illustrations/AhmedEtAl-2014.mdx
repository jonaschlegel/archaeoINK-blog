## Abstract

This article by Nafis Ahmed, Matthew Carter, and Neal Ferris explores the concept of sustainable archaeology through the use of progressive assembly 3D digitization. Published in _World Archaeology_, the paper presents innovative methods for digitally preserving archaeological artifacts and sites, offering a sustainable approach to data management and conservation. By leveraging 3D digitization technologies, the authors propose a model for minimizing the physical manipulation of artifacts while maximizing their accessibility for research and public engagement.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is intended for archaeologists, digital heritage professionals, and researchers focused on sustainable practices in archaeology. It provides an in-depth analysis of how progressive assembly 3D digitization can contribute to more sustainable archaeological practices by reducing physical handling of artifacts and improving long-term preservation.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: The Role of Sustainability in Archaeology
2. Progressive Assembly: An Overview of 3D Digitization Techniques
3. Case Studies in Sustainable Archaeology
4. Implications for Artifact Conservation and Research
5. Conclusion: Toward a Sustainable Future in Archaeology

## Key Excerpt

"3D digitization offers a sustainable alternative to traditional archaeological methods by enabling detailed documentation without the need for repeated physical handling of artifacts. This approach not only preserves fragile objects but also enhances access for researchers and the public alike."
