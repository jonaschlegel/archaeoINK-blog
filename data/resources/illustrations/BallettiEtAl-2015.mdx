## Abstract

This article presents a case study on the 3D reconstruction of marble cargoes from shipwrecks using underwater multi-image photogrammetry. Authored by Cinzia Balletti, Carla Beltrame, Elisa Costa, Francesco Guerra, and Paolo Vernier, the paper outlines the methodologies and technologies employed in creating accurate 3D models of submerged archaeological sites. Published in "Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage", the study highlights how photogrammetry can be used to digitally preserve and study delicate underwater artifacts.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at archaeologists, underwater researchers, and digital heritage professionals interested in applying 3D technologies to underwater archaeology. It provides practical insights into the use of multi-image photogrammetry for recording and reconstructing submerged archaeological finds, specifically marble cargoes from shipwrecks.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: Challenges in Underwater Archaeology
2. Multi-Image Photogrammetry Techniques
3. Case Study: Marble Shipwreck Cargoes
4. Results of the 3D Reconstruction Process
5. Conclusion: Benefits and Future Applications of Photogrammetry

## Key Excerpt

"Underwater photogrammetry allows for precise and non-invasive documentation of shipwrecks and their cargoes, making it possible to create 3D models that preserve the site's integrity while providing detailed data for further research and analysis."

## Reviews

Balletti et al.â€™s study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-image photogrammetry in underwater archaeology, providing a robust method for reconstructing and analyzing submerged artifacts.
