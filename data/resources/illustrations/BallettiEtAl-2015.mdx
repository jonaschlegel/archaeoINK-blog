## Abstract

This article presents a case study on the 3D reconstruction of marble cargoes from shipwrecks using underwater multi-image photogrammetry. Authored by Cinzia Balletti, Carla Beltrame, Elisa Costa, Francesco Guerra, and Paolo Vernier, the paper outlines the methodologies and technologies employed in creating accurate 3D models of submerged archaeological sites. Published in _Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage_, the study highlights how photogrammetry can be used to digitally preserve and study delicate underwater artifacts.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at archaeologists, underwater researchers, and digital heritage professionals interested in applying 3D technologies to underwater archaeology. It provides practical insights into the use of multi-image photogrammetry for recording and reconstructing submerged archaeological finds, specifically marble cargoes from shipwrecks.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: Challenges in Underwater Archaeology
