## Abstract

This guideline paper, published by the Prehistoric Ceramics Research Group in 1992, provides comprehensive protocols for the analysis and publication of later prehistoric pottery. Authored by Sue Hamilton, Ann Woodward, Alison Barclay, and Lisa Brown, the document outlines systematic methods to enhance the accuracy and standardisation of ceramic studies. The guidelines cover a range of variables from fabric type and form to manufacturing techniques and decoration, presenting detailed frameworks for data collection, quantification, and illustration. It aims to standardise ceramic analysis across different projects to facilitate comparative research and ensure that findings contribute robustly to our understanding of prehistoric socio-cultural and economic contexts.

## Purpose and Audience

The guidelines are intended for archaeologists, ceramic analysts, and researchers involved in the study of prehistoric ceramics. The purpose is to establish a consistent methodology that enhances the comparability of pottery studies across Britain and supports a deeper understanding of manufacturing, trade, and usage patterns in prehistoric societies.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: Goals and Importance of Ceramic Studies
2. Variables for Recording
   - Fabric Type
   - Form
   - Quantification Methods
   - Vessel Dimensions
3. Surface Treatment, Decoration, and Manufacturing Techniques
4. Data Collection for Pottery Illustrations
5. Storage and Archival Standards
6. References and Further Reading

## Key Excerpt

"Not all variables can be recorded for all pottery, nor will it be necessary to record all variables for every assemblage. The selection will depend on the post-excavation research design... to provide robust data for regional and national studies." (p. 3)

## Difficulty Level

Advanced â€“ Suitable for experienced ceramic analysts and archaeologists with prior understanding of pottery analysis techniques and archaeological methodology.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This document is a highly practical resource for ceramic analysis in archaeology. Its structured approach to data recording and standardisation makes it essential for any comprehensive pottery study, particularly in later prehistoric research. It provides specific guidance on selecting variables for documentation and the recommended processes for fabric and form analysis.

## Benefits of the Resource

- Standardisation: Establishes a consistent methodology, enabling cross-project comparison.
- Comprehensive Detail: Covers every aspect of pottery analysis, from fabric composition to post-excavation storage.
- Clear Framework for Analysis: Assists analysts in constructing robust datasets that enhance the understanding of prehistoric pottery production and distribution.

## Limitations of the Resource

- Focus on British Context: While thorough for British prehistoric ceramics, the guidelines may not fully apply to other regions without modifications.
- Resource-Intensive: The comprehensive detail may require more time and resources than are available for smaller projects or preliminary studies.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The paper does not include hands-on exercises but offers extensive examples and visual aids for identifying fabric types, surface treatments, and decorations. These serve as a useful reference for analysts applying the guidelines to their work.
