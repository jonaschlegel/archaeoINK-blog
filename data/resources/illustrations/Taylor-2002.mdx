## Abstract

This educational guide by Anne Taylor provides an accessible introduction to the techniques and conventions of archaeological illustration, featuring hands-on exercises and annotated examples. Aimed at students and beginners, the resource draws on the SCRAN database, using a range of artefacts, including small metal objects, pottery, and stone tools, to teach step-by-step drawing techniques. The guide explains the rationale for archaeological illustration, outlines necessary equipment, and includes detailed exercises that explore various methods for rendering depth, texture, and perspective.

## Purpose and Audience

Designed for students, amateur archaeologists, and museum professionals, this guide serves as a fundamental introduction to archaeological drawing. It provides a structured path from basic concepts to more complex rendering techniques, making it particularly useful for educational settings and self-study by those looking to develop foundational skills in artefact illustration.

## Key Excerpt

“Whether you are drawing a silver brooch or a piece of pottery, the general principle remains the same: to draw an accurate outline of the object, as if viewed from directly above or from the side, to scale and with sufficient detail to show how it was constructed and used.” (p. 3)

## Difficulty Level

Beginner. The resource requires no previous experience and is designed to be a practical entry point into archaeological illustration, with exercises progressively building technical skills.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This resource is highly practical for educational use, particularly in archaeology courses or introductory workshops on illustration techniques. It systematically introduces students to the conventions and purposes of artefact illustration, highlighting its value for documentation, research, and museum collections.

## Benefits of the Resource

The guide’s structured, exercise-based approach makes it particularly effective for teaching and self-study, covering all essential aspects of archaeological illustration in a straightforward manner. By focusing on commonly encountered artefacts, it also offers a realistic and applied perspective on the skills needed for archaeological documentation.

## Limitations of the Resource

The guide is limited in scope to foundational techniques and does not explore advanced methods or digital illustration tools, which have become increasingly important in archaeological practice. Additionally, it is specific to certain artefact types and may need supplementation for drawing complex artefacts or features like lithic refits or 3D reconstructions.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

Each section provides practical drawing exercises with detailed, step-by-step guidance. Exercises range from basic line and shading techniques to more complex renderings of specific artefact types, such as metal objects and pottery. No formal case studies are included, but the resource is highly practical for learning purposes.

## Reviews

No formal reviews are included in the document. However, as an educational resource, it is often cited and recommended in academic settings for its clear, step-by-step methodology.
