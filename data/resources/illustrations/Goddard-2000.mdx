## Abstract

Seán Goddard’s article explores the enduring significance of illustration in archaeology through the contributions of Robert Gurd. Active from 1913 to 1938, Gurd was a pivotal figure in documenting archaeological artefacts, with a style that emphasised precision and clarity. This piece revisits the importance of line drawing, especially in rendering archaeological details often obscured in photographs, and evaluates Gurd’s influence on pottery and artefact illustration standards. Goddard contends that Gurd’s meticulous, hand-drawn illustrations continue to exemplify best practices in archaeological documentation.

## Purpose and Audience

Aimed at archaeologists, historians, and illustrators, this article celebrates traditional illustration methods and advocates for their continued relevance in archaeological documentation. It underscores the skill required for effective artefact illustration, using Gurd’s work as a benchmark.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction to Archaeological Illustration
2. Robert Gurd's Background and Influence
3. Gurd’s Approach to Artifact Illustration
4. Case Studies: Pottery, Flint, and Bronze Artifacts
5. Technical Excellence and Limitations in Modern Publication

## Key Excerpt

“Without drawing and designing, the study of Antiquities is lame and imperfect...illustration is a powerful, almost universal, medium for the dissemination of knowledge of the past as it is discovered by archaeology” (p. 7)

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate – The text is accessible to those with a general interest in archaeology and requires only a basic understanding of archaeological documentation practices.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

Goddard’s article is highly relevant for those interested in archaeological illustration, providing a case for the enduring value of hand-drawn illustrations and emphasising standards that remain applicable in both print and digital formats.

## Benefits of the Resource

- Historical Context: The article presents a rich historical perspective on archaeological illustration and its evolution, reflecting on early 20th-century practices.
- Best Practices in Illustration: By highlighting Gurd’s meticulous style, Goddard’s article indirectly outlines best practices in documenting artefacts through line drawing.
- Advocacy for Line Illustration: The text provides a strong argument for retaining traditional line drawing techniques, even as digital methods advance.

## Limitations of the Resource

- Focus on Traditional Methods: While it acknowledges technological changes, the article’s focus on traditional illustration may limit its appeal for those interested exclusively in modern digital techniques.
- Region-Specific Focus: Gurd’s work is primarily tied to Sussex archaeology, so readers seeking a broader international perspective may find the regional focus somewhat restrictive.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The article offers descriptive case studies of Gurd’s illustrations for artefacts such as flint, bronze, and pottery, but does not include procedural exercises.
