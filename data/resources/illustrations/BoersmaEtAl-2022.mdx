## Abstract

This comprehensive guide by Boersma and Los-Weijns focuses on the standardisation of archaeological illustration techniques. Covering a range of artefacts, it details methods for creating accurate drawings of complete vessels, potsherds, and other artefacts, including techniques for measuring, drawing, marking, and digitally scanning or photographing objects. The authors aim to improve the quality and consistency of archaeological illustrations for publication, underscoring the importance of clear visual documentation in archaeology.

## Purpose and Audience

The guide is intended for professional archaeological illustrators, students, and field archaeologists involved in documentation and publication. It serves both as an instructional manual for those new to draughtsmanship and a reference for experienced illustrators seeking to standardise their work according to professional conventions.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction
2. Tools and Equipment
3. Drawing Complete Vessels
4. Drawing Potsherds
5. Drawing Other Artefacts
6. Marking and Scanning
7. Photographing Artefacts

## Key Excerpt

"Drawing will allow (partial) reconstruction of an object. Unlike photography, drawing allows sections of objects to be shown… The drawings in pencil are scanned and (digitally or manually) traced in ink to make them suitable for publication." (p. 1)

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate. While the guide includes foundational explanations and step-by-step instructions, it also delves into technical specifics that are especially valuable for practitioners already familiar with basic archaeological methods.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This guide is highly practical, especially for those in academic and commercial archaeology who must produce consistent, publishable illustrations. By promoting standardised techniques and covering both traditional and digital approaches, the guide addresses current professional needs within archaeological illustration.

## Benefits of the Resource

The resource provides a structured and detailed approach to archaeological draughtsmanship, ensuring that each type of artefact receives focused instruction. Its guidance on digital tools and scanning processes adds versatility, allowing illustrators to adapt their work to contemporary publishing standards. The inclusion of marking and photography techniques further enhances the guide’s applicability in creating comprehensive visual records.

## Limitations of the Resource

The guide is specific to object illustration and does not explore broader landscape or site plans. Some readers may also find the digital sections limited, as it covers basic scanning and Photoshop adjustments rather than more advanced digital illustration techniques.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

Each section includes practical guidelines and illustrative steps for drawing and measuring artefacts. Although not formal exercises, these guidelines serve as structured exercises, enabling readers to apply the techniques to actual archaeological objects.

## Reviews

This guide is well-regarded within academic and professional archaeology circles for its detailed approach and emphasis on standardisation, though no formal reviews are included in the document itself.
