## Key Excerpt

“Composition and careful colour choice enable an artist to bring balance and life to a botanical illustration, transforming a simple study into a cohesive work that communicates both the aesthetics and biology of the subject.” (p. 7)

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate to Advanced – Price’s instruction assumes prior knowledge of botanical illustration basics, moving quickly into nuanced techniques and advanced colour theory applications.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This resource is highly practical for serious botanical illustrators. It integrates specific colour exercises with compositional guidance, providing a structured approach to improving both the technical and creative aspects of botanical art.

## Benefits of the Resource

- Focus on Composition: Offers clear guidance on arranging botanical subjects, emphasising the storytelling potential of a well-planned composition.
- Detailed Colour Studies: Each lesson provides a deep dive into using a specific colour effectively, covering essential pigments, shading techniques, and blending methods.
- Step-by-Step Projects: Practical exercises walk readers through the development of complex botanical compositions, enabling hands-on practice in a structured format.

## Limitations of the Resource

- Assumes Prior Knowledge: Beginners may find it challenging to follow without familiarity with foundational illustration techniques.
- Traditional Focus: While thorough on watercolour techniques, the book does not address digital illustration methods, which may be a drawback for artists looking to explore digital media.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

Each chapter includes a specific exercise focused on using a particular colour in botanical illustration. Lessons on colour are paired with compositional exercises, allowing readers to apply techniques in both isolating elements and creating multi-part compositions with natural flow.
