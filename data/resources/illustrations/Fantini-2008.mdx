## Abstract

In this article, Massimo Fantini explores the 3D restitution, restoration, and prototyping of a medieval damaged skull using rapid prototyping technologies. Published in the "Rapid Prototyping Journal", the paper discusses how 3D scanning, modeling, and printing technologies are used to reconstruct and restore the skull, offering new methods for preserving archaeological finds and studying historical remains.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at archaeologists, forensic anthropologists, and digital heritage professionals interested in applying 3D restoration techniques to damaged artifacts. It provides insights into how 3D prototyping can aid in the preservation and analysis of skeletal remains.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: Rapid Prototyping in Archaeology
2. Methodology: 3D Scanning and Modeling the Skull
3. Restitution and Restoration of the Skull
4. 3D Prototyping for Analysis
5. Conclusion: Future Applications in Archaeology and Forensics

## Key Excerpt

"Rapid prototyping allows archaeologists and anthropologists to digitally restore damaged artifacts and remains, creating physical models that can be used for research, display, and further analysis without damaging the original object."

## Reviews

Fantini's article presents a fascinating case study in how rapid prototyping technologies can be applied to archaeological restoration, offering new methods for both preservation and research.
