## Abstract

In this chapter, James Hindmarch, Melissa Terras, and Stuart Robson explore the concept of the "virtual aura" of cultural heritage objects in the age of 3D digital reproduction. Published in _The Routledge International Handbook of New Digital Practices in Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums and Heritage Sites_, the chapter discusses how the digital reproduction of artifacts alters their perceived authenticity and value. The authors consider the implications of 3D technologies on the preservation, presentation, and interpretation of cultural heritage.

## Purpose and Audience

This chapter is aimed at digital heritage professionals, museum curators, and researchers interested in the impact of 3D digital reproduction on cultural heritage. It offers a theoretical exploration of how digital technologies shape the way artifacts are experienced and understood in both physical and virtual spaces.
