## Abstract

This article, authored by Kelsey Garstki, M. P. Schulenburg, and R. A. Cook, discusses the practical application of digital photogrammetry for archaeological fieldwork, focusing on a case study from the Middle Ohio Valley. Published in the _Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology_, the paper highlights the benefits of using photogrammetry in field settings, providing a detailed account of how 3D models are created from photographic data. The authors explore the use of digital photogrammetry for site documentation, analysis, and interpretation in the context of Midwest archaeology.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is intended for archaeologists, researchers, and digital heritage professionals interested in applying photogrammetry to fieldwork. It offers practical guidance on how to implement digital photogrammetry techniques in archaeological contexts, particularly in the American Midwest.
