## Abstract

This article, authored by Kelsey Garstki, M. P. Schulenburg, and R. A. Cook, discusses the practical application of digital photogrammetry for archaeological fieldwork, focusing on a case study from the Middle Ohio Valley. Published in the "Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology", the paper highlights the benefits of using photogrammetry in field settings, providing a detailed account of how 3D models are created from photographic data. The authors explore the use of digital photogrammetry for site documentation, analysis, and interpretation in the context of Midwest archaeology.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is intended for archaeologists, researchers, and digital heritage professionals interested in applying photogrammetry to fieldwork. It offers practical guidance on how to implement digital photogrammetry techniques in archaeological contexts, particularly in the American Midwest.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: The Role of Photogrammetry in Field Archaeology
2. Methodology: Implementing Digital Photogrammetry in the Ohio Valley
3. Case Study: Fieldwork in the Middle Ohio Valley
4. Results: 3D Modeling for Site Documentation and Analysis
5. Conclusion: Practical Applications and Challenges of Photogrammetry

## Key Excerpt

"Digital photogrammetry offers archaeologists an efficient and accurate method of documenting field sites, creating 3D models that provide a detailed record of site features and artifacts for both research and preservation."

## Reviews

Garstki et al.â€™s work provides an excellent example of how digital photogrammetry can be applied to field archaeology, offering practical insights for researchers in the American Midwest.
