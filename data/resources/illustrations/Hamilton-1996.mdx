## Abstract

Sue Hamilton’s article challenges the conventions of archaeological illustration, particularly for prehistoric pottery. Published in "Graphic Archaeology", Hamilton critiques formulaic approaches in excavation reports, arguing that the standardisation of illustration and report layouts has rendered archaeological findings visually “sanitised” and disconnected from interpretative goals. Hamilton proposes that illustrations should incorporate more contextual information, including stratigraphic relationships and material codes, to facilitate a holistic understanding of artefacts within their social and economic contexts.

## Purpose and Audience

The article is aimed at archaeologists, illustrators, and academic publishers. Hamilton advocates for a reform of illustration practices, emphasising interpretative and user-focused approaches that go beyond conventional standards in British excavation reports.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction to Conventional Archaeological Illustration
2. Critique of Formulaic Layouts in Excavation Reports
3. Case Studies in Pottery Illustration
4. Proposed Reforms in Archaeological Illustration Practices
5. Conclusion: Towards Dynamic and Interpretative Imagery

## Key Excerpt

"Illustrations collude in [giving] an unnaturally 'sanitised' and 'fixed' view of the data which fails to engage the 'reader'... More attention needs to be paid to how the illustrations are going to be used, or perhaps not used, once published" (p. 20)

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate – The article assumes familiarity with excavation report formats and the conventions of archaeological illustration.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This work is highly relevant for archaeological illustrators and report writers. It encourages reflection on current practices and offers practical recommendations, especially for pottery documentation, that could enhance the analytical value of illustrated reports.

## Benefits of the Resource

- Critical Insight: Hamilton's perspective encourages archaeologists to rethink traditional layouts and consider illustrations as interpretative tools.
- Practical Suggestions: Recommendations include annotating illustrations with context information, using flexible scales, and presenting artefacts alongside their contextual artefacts.
- Encouragement of Innovation: The article encourages breaking away from the restrictive conventions that have dominated archaeological illustration for decades.

## Limitations of the Resource

- Focus on British Prehistory: The article’s focus on British prehistoric pottery may limit its direct applicability to other regions or types of artefacts.
- Implementation Challenges: While Hamilton advocates innovative practices, these may increase costs or complexity for publications with limited resources.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

Hamilton provides case examples of pottery illustrations, including annotated illustrations from prehistoric sites, that support her call for more dynamic presentation methods. However, the article does not include hands-on exercises.
