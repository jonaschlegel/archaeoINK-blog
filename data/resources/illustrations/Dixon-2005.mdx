## Abstract

This chapter by Susan M. Dixon examines Piranesi’s _Il Campo Marzio_ through the lens of uchronia, exploring how the illustrations blur temporal boundaries and reimagine Ancient Rome. Dixon delves into the ways Piranesi’s work, particularly his use of iconography, creates an alternative historical narrative that challenges conventional views of time and space in archaeology. This chapter is part of the edited volume _Envisioning the Past: Archaeology and the Image_ by Smiles and Moser.

## Purpose and Audience

This chapter is aimed at art historians, archaeologists, and scholars with an interest in visual culture and the intersection of archaeology and artistic representation. It appeals to those studying Piranesi’s influence on the visualization of ancient Rome and the broader implications of uchronia in historical narratives.

## Key Excerpt

"Piranesi’s _Il Campo Marzio_ not only reconstructs the topography of Ancient Rome but also warps time by juxtaposing multiple eras within a single visual framework. His illustrations are both archaeological and fantastical, offering viewers a complex, layered interpretation of Rome’s past."
