## Abstract

This chapter by Susan M. Dixon examines Piranesi’s "Il Campo Marzio" through the lens of uchronia, exploring how the illustrations blur temporal boundaries and reimagine Ancient Rome. Dixon delves into the ways Piranesi’s work, particularly his use of iconography, creates an alternative historical narrative that challenges conventional views of time and space in archaeology. This chapter is part of the edited volume "Envisioning the Past: Archaeology and the Image" by Smiles and Moser.

## Purpose and Audience

This chapter is aimed at art historians, archaeologists, and scholars with an interest in visual culture and the intersection of archaeology and artistic representation. It appeals to those studying Piranesi’s influence on the visualization of ancient Rome and the broader implications of uchronia in historical narratives.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: Time and Iconography in Piranesi’s Work
2. Uchronia and the Temporal Dislocation of "Il Campo Marzio"
3. Piranesi’s Use of Iconography
4. The Reinterpretation of Ancient Rome in the 18th Century
5. Conclusion: Visualizing Time and Space in Archaeology

## Key Excerpt

"Piranesi’s 'Il Campo Marzio' not only reconstructs the topography of Ancient Rome but also warps time by juxtaposing multiple eras within a single visual framework. His illustrations are both archaeological and fantastical, offering viewers a complex, layered interpretation of Rome’s past."

## Reviews

An insightful examination of how Piranesi’s illustrations disrupt traditional perceptions of time and space in archaeology.
