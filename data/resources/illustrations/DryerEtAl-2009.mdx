## Abstract

This paper by Marc Dryer and David Mazierski presents a digital method for illustrating archaeological artifacts, specifically flaked lithic tools. This method combines traditional and digital rendering techniques, utilising a vector-based graphics program to trace photographs of artifacts, thereby achieving detailed line drawings of silhouettes, flake scars, and other textural details. The authors argue that this digital technique can yield scalable, accurate illustrations that meet the rigorous standards of archaeological documentation.

## Purpose and Audience

The article targets professional illustrators, archaeologists, and students, providing a resource for accurately representing stone artifacts in scientific publications. The approach offers a hybrid solution that respects traditional conventions while leveraging digital tools to streamline and refine the illustration process.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction to Lithic Artifact Illustration
2. Rendering Stages
   - Silhouette Profile
   - Internal Features
   - Texture Details
3. Digital Vector Rendering
4. Techniques for Digital Tracing
5. Concluding Remarks on Digital Approaches

## Key Excerpt

"The conventions observed in lithic artifact illustration include the use of common figurative elements, such as a scale bar and symbols indicating key features... This approach allows professional illustrators, researchers, and students of archaeology to create competent scientific illustrations in conformity with the conventions for this specialised discipline." (p. E35)

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate to Advanced – The article assumes familiarity with both lithic artefacts and vector-based digital illustration software.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

The paper is highly relevant for fields involving artefact illustration and archaeological documentation. Its practical guidance on digital techniques offers advantages for professionals needing precision and scalability in their work.

## Benefits of the Resource

- Accuracy and Scalability: Digital vector rendering is described as offering precision in capturing flake scars and silhouette profiles.
- Enhanced Legibility: The standardised conventions enable comparison across illustrations, aiding in the analytical process.
- Methodological Versatility: Dryer and Mazierski’s digital approach is adaptable and allows integration with traditional pen-and-ink techniques if desired.

## Limitations of the Resource

- Technical Skill Requirement: Familiarity with digital vector programs and techniques is necessary, which could be a barrier for individuals with traditional illustration training.
- Software Dependence: The approach relies on access to professional digital graphics software, which may not be universally available.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The article includes practical instructions on creating digital renderings of artefacts, such as tracing silhouette profiles and adding flake scar textures. However, it does not provide full case studies or exercises but rather detailed procedural guidelines.
