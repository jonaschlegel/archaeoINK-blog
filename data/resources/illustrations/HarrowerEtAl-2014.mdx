## Abstract

This article by Michael J. Harrower and colleagues presents a detailed case study on the use of 3D modeling to digitally reconstruct a Bronze Age tower in Oman. Published in _World Archaeology_, the paper explores how digital models were created to visualize the structure and analyze its archaeological significance. The authors discuss the benefits of 3D technologies in providing new insights into architectural features that are not always evident through traditional archaeological methods.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at archaeologists, digital heritage professionals, and researchers interested in using 3D modeling to study ancient structures. It provides a practical example of how digital models can enhance the interpretation of archaeological sites, particularly in the context of large architectural remains.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: 3D Modeling in Archaeology
2. Methodology: Digital Reconstruction of the Bronze Age Tower
3. Results: Visualization and Interpretation of Architectural Features
4. Benefits of 3D Modeling for Archaeological Research
5. Conclusion: New Insights from Digital Reconstruction

## Key Excerpt

"3D modeling offers archaeologists the ability to visualize and interpret architectural structures in ways that would not be possible through traditional excavation alone. In the case of the Bronze Age tower in Oman, digital models provided new insights into its construction and use."
