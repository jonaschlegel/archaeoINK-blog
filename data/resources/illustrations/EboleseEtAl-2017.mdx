## Abstract

This article by Domenico Ebolese, Marco Brutto, and Antonio Burgio presents a case study on the 3D modeling of two louteria (ancient Greek basins) fragments using an image-based approach. Published in _Geomatics & Restoration_, the paper details the process of creating accurate 3D models from photographic data, highlighting the use of photogrammetry for the preservation and study of delicate cultural heritage artifacts.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is intended for archaeologists, cultural heritage professionals, and digital heritage specialists interested in applying image-based 3D modeling to the restoration of ancient artifacts. It provides a detailed analysis of the methodology and tools used in reconstructing louteria fragments.
