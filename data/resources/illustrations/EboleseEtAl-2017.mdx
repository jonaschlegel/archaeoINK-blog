## Abstract

This article by Domenico Ebolese, Marco Brutto, and Antonio Burgio presents a case study on the 3D modeling of two louteria (ancient Greek basins) fragments using an image-based approach. Published in "Geomatics & Restoration", the paper details the process of creating accurate 3D models from photographic data, highlighting the use of photogrammetry for the preservation and study of delicate cultural heritage artifacts.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is intended for archaeologists, cultural heritage professionals, and digital heritage specialists interested in applying image-based 3D modeling to the restoration of ancient artifacts. It provides a detailed analysis of the methodology and tools used in reconstructing louteria fragments.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction to Image-Based 3D Modeling
2. Methodology: Photogrammetry for Cultural Heritage
3. Case Study: Louteria Fragments Restoration
4. Results: 3D Models and Analysis
5. Conclusion: Applications and Future Research

## Key Excerpt

"Using photogrammetry to create 3D models of fragile artifacts offers a non-invasive method of documentation and analysis, ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage while providing detailed visual data for further research."

## Reviews

Ebolese et al.'s work demonstrates the effectiveness of image-based 3D modeling in the field of artifact restoration, offering a valuable method for studying delicate archaeological objects.
