## Key Excerpt

“Drawing lithic artefacts is bound to rules and conventions anybody can learn...while the art world may be better off without my artistic bent, I have found a new purpose in making lithic illustrations, which allows for the satisfaction of mastering a craft with a tangible outcome” (p. 1)

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate. The book assumes little prior experience in lithic illustration and provides foundational guidance for all skill levels, with a focus on building fundamental skills for consistent, high-quality drawings.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This guide is highly practical for archaeologists, students, and illustrators who wish to develop a technical drawing skillset specifically tailored to lithic artefacts. It reinforces standard conventions, offering a structured process that aligns with the professional demands of archaeological reporting and publication.

## Benefits of the Resource

The structured approach of Drawing Lithic Artefacts makes it highly accessible. Raczynski-Henk demystifies the drawing process, breaking down each stage with sufficient detail to help readers achieve competence and clarity in their illustrations. The book also highlights the cognitive value of drawing, enhancing an archaeologist's understanding of artefact morphology and manufacturing techniques.

## Limitations of the Resource

While comprehensive, the guide primarily uses manual drawing techniques and briefly touches upon digital methods, suggesting that it may be supplemented with more advanced digital resources. Additionally, while the book introduces relevant conventions, readers may need to consult other resources for in-depth cross-cultural conventions in lithic illustration.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The book provides practical drawing exercises but does not include formal case studies. However, the detailed step-by-step instructions function as exercises, especially for those new to the conventions of lithic illustration.

## Reviews

While formal reviews are not provided within the book, Drawing Lithic Artefacts has been praised within archaeological illustration circles for its clear, comprehensive approach to a traditionally challenging skill.
