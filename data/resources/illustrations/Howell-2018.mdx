## Abstract

In this chapter, David Howell discusses the potential of hyperspectral imaging in researching color on artifacts. Published in _Digital Imaging of Artefacts: Developments in Methods and Aims_, the chapter highlights the capabilities of hyperspectral imaging technology to capture a wide range of spectral data, revealing subtle color variations that are not visible to the naked eye. Howell provides case studies demonstrating how this technology can be applied to the study and preservation of archaeological and historical artifacts.

## Purpose and Audience

This chapter is intended for archaeologists, conservators, and researchers interested in applying advanced imaging technologies to the analysis of color on artifacts. It offers insights into how hyperspectral imaging can enhance the study of material culture, providing new data for both research and conservation.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: Hyperspectral Imaging in Archaeology
2. Techniques for Imaging Color on Artifacts
3. Case Studies: Using Hyperspectral Imaging to Analyze Artifacts
4. Results: Understanding Color Variations on Ancient Objects
5. Conclusion: The Future of Hyperspectral Imaging in Archaeology

## Key Excerpt

"Hyperspectral imaging allows researchers to capture detailed spectral data that reveals color variations invisible to the naked eye, providing new insights into the materials and techniques used in artifact production."
