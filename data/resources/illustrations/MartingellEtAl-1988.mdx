## Key Excerpt

"The booklet is aimed primarily at illustrators who are not themselves lithic specialists but who are in the position of preparing drawings to accompany specialist lithic reports for publication in archaeological journals and books... The experienced lithic illustrator may find little herein that is new, but it is hoped that the novice illustrator... will be helped by the following points and guidelines." (p. 1)

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate. The guide assumes some familiarity with basic archaeological drawing but provides detailed instructions accessible to both beginner and intermediate practitioners.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This guide is highly practical for field archaeologists, illustrators, and publication editors involved in lithic studies. By covering various tool types and providing conventions for rendering distinct lithic features, the guide supports the standardisation of lithic illustrations, which is essential for consistency in archaeological publications.

## Benefits of the Resource

The guide's thorough instructions and clear illustrations make it an invaluable resource for producing scientifically accurate lithic illustrations. Its emphasis on visual harmony, accuracy, and communication between illustrators and specialists ensures that lithic illustrations meet professional standards in archaeological documentation.

## Limitations of the Resource

The guide, published in 1988, may not cover recent developments in digital illustration technologies. Additionally, while the guide touches upon the collaboration between specialists and illustrators, it could benefit from expanded discussion on handling more complex artefact assemblages or heavily fragmented pieces.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

This booklet contains practical, step-by-step techniques rather than formal exercises, guiding illustrators through each stage of the lithic illustration process. It includes examples, schematic diagrams, and instructions for specific artefact types, enhancing its usability.

## Reviews

While no contemporary reviews are included in the booklet, it remains a respected reference among archaeological illustrators and is frequently cited in archaeological literature.
