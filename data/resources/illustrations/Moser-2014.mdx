## Abstract

In this article, Stephanie Moser examines the role of visual representation in the production of expert knowledge, tracing connections between antiquarian illustration and early modern scientific illustration. Published in _Isis_, the journal of the History of Science Society, Moser explores how images were used as tools to convey scientific ideas and establish authority in the study of antiquity and early science. The article provides a historical analysis of how illustrations contributed to the professionalization of archaeological and scientific practices.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at historians of science, archaeologists, and scholars interested in the role of images in the formation of expert knowledge. It offers valuable insights into how scientific illustration served not only as documentation but as a means to legitimize and communicate specialized knowledge.
