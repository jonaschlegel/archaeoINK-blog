## Abstract

This practical guide by Thomas Small offers an in-depth look at the illustration of small archaeological finds, providing a modern perspective that integrates traditional practices with digital tools. Emphasising accuracy and collaborative processes, it covers techniques for handling diverse artefacts, including case studies of a medieval bone comb and a clay pipe. The guide is particularly valuable for illustrators working within commercial and academic settings, where precision, time management, and teamwork are essential.

## Purpose and Audience

This guide is designed for professional archaeological illustrators, students, and field archaeologists who need a structured approach to illustrating small finds. It’s useful for those transitioning to digital techniques, as it highlights the applications of software and scanning in archaeological illustration while maintaining a strong foundation in traditional methods.

## Key Excerpt

"One of the most common questions that the archaeological illustrator encounters is, ‘Why not just photograph it?’ The answer is that whilst a photograph can complement a line illustration by communicating texture and colour, a well-executed illustration will effectively communicate an object’s three-dimensional nature.” (p. 3)

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate to Advanced. The guide is aimed at those familiar with basic archaeological principles and includes technical insights into both traditional and digital illustration processes.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This guide is highly relevant for practitioners in the field, bridging the gap between traditional and digital illustration methods. By focusing on small finds, it addresses unique challenges such as detailed decoration, accurate scaling, and optimal representation of three-dimensional aspects, making it invaluable in both field and academic archaeology contexts.

## Benefits of the Resource

The guide provides a detailed, step-by-step approach for illustrating small finds, complemented by case studies that demonstrate real-life applications of the techniques. Its emphasis on digital tools, such as graphic tablets and illustration software, equips illustrators with practical skills for adapting to modern archaeological documentation.

## Limitations of the Resource

While thorough in its coverage of small finds illustration, the guide is specific to this category and does not address techniques for illustrating larger artefacts, architectural features, or environmental contexts. Additionally, although it introduces digital techniques, it does not offer detailed tutorials for specific software.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The guide includes two detailed case studies: a medieval bone comb and a clay smoking pipe. These examples offer a practical understanding of measuring, tracing, and shading techniques, as well as digital methods such as scanning and vector illustration, making it a hands-on resource for learning.

## Reviews

No formal reviews are provided within the document, but the guide is widely regarded within the archaeological illustration community for its clear integration of digital and traditional approaches to small finds illustration.
