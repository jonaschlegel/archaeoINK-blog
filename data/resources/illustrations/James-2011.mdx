## Abstract

In this chapter, Simon James explores the theoretical and practical aspects of visual reconstructions in archaeology. Focusing on how illustrations and visualizations can shape and sometimes mislead interpretations of archaeological findings, the chapter addresses both the methodological challenges and the interpretative power of visual reconstructions. This contribution is part of the edited volume _The Cultural Life of Images: Visual Representation in Archaeology_, edited by Brian Molyneaux.

## Purpose and Audience

This chapter is aimed at archaeologists, illustrators, and scholars interested in the intersection of visual representation and archaeological theory. It provides a critical examination of how drawings and visual reconstructions influence our understanding of the past and challenges practitioners to reflect on the assumptions built into their work.

## Key Excerpt

"Visual reconstructions are not passive representations of archaeological findings; they actively shape how we think about the past. The choices made by illustrators and archaeologists in crafting these images have significant implications for interpretation and understanding."
