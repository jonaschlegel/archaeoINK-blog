## Abstract

This paper presents a multi-scale approach for generating 3D line drawings of archaeological artefacts. Authors Tao Luo, Renju Li, and Hongbin Zha introduce a computer-generated method to assist traditional line drawings through a probabilistic selection process and mesh smoothing via random walks. Using a Markov Random Field (MRF) model, this approach captures convex and concave features, allowing for scalable, view-independent illustrations. The authors report significant time savings in archaeological mapping, with experiments conducted on heritage artefacts from the Longmen Grottoes in China. The results demonstrate accuracy improvements in line detection and noise reduction, enhancing digital preservation and restoration workflows for complex cultural heritage objects.

## Purpose and Audience

This paper is aimed at archaeologists, computer scientists, and digital heritage researchers interested in automated illustration methods and 3D modelling for cultural heritage. It proposes a computational approach to streamline and enhance the precision of archaeological illustrations, serving as a tool for both documentation and scholarly analysis.

## Key Excerpt

“Our method can generate line drawings with multiple scales and different view directions. The detected lines can be used as assistance for archaeologists... offering an alternative to the expensive, time-consuming, and inaccurate manual method.” (p. 912)

## Difficulty Level

Advanced – The technical detail, including the probabilistic modelling and random walk algorithms, requires familiarity with 3D graphics, machine learning, and computer vision.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

Highly relevant to digital archaeology, this work offers a new solution for efficiently producing accurate line drawings, essential for artefact documentation. The method is especially beneficial for complex artefacts with intricate features where traditional drawing techniques fall short.

## Benefits of the Resource

- Efficiency: Demonstrates a dramatic reduction in time needed for archaeological mapping.
- High Precision: The multi-scale, probabilistic method enhances detail accuracy in line drawings compared to manual techniques.
- Noise Reduction: Offers robust performance against data noise, making it suitable for weathered or eroded artefacts.

## Limitations of the Resource

- Complex Implementation: Requires specialised knowledge in 3D modelling and machine learning, which could be a barrier for purely archaeology-focused practitioners.
- Limited Artistic Control: The method’s automated nature may lack the interpretative nuance achievable by manual drawing in some cases.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The paper includes experimental results from artefacts at the Longmen Grottoes, highlighting the effectiveness of the method in both large-scale and detailed artefact illustrations. However, it does not include practical exercises for users.
