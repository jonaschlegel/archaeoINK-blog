## Abstract

This article by Ian Dawson and Paul Reilly, published in _Epoiesen_, explores the concept of phygital (physical-digital) archaeology, focusing on how messy assemblages and residuality are interpreted and visualized through recursive processes. The authors discuss how the intersection of physical and digital methods influences archaeological practice and theory, with particular attention to how objects and digital data interact within this nexus.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at archaeologists, digital humanists, and researchers interested in the intersection of physical and digital methods in archaeology. It provides theoretical insights into how hybrid approaches shape the understanding of archaeological assemblages.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: Defining the Phygital Nexus
2. Residuality in Archaeology
3. Recursive Processes in Archaeological Interpretation
4. Case Studies in Phygital Archaeology
5. Conclusion: Bridging the Physical and Digital in Archaeological Practice

## Key Excerpt

"By embracing both physical and digital methodologies, archaeologists can develop a more holistic understanding of material culture, where objects and digital data co-exist and inform each other within a recursive and iterative process."

## Reviews

A fascinating exploration of the phygital in archaeology, combining theoretical insights with practical applications.
