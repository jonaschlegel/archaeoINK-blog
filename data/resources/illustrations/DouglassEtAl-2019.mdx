## Abstract

This article by Matthew J. Douglass and colleagues examines the role of virtual reconstruction in archaeological observation and interpretation. Published in _Affordances in Archaeological Practice_, the paper discusses how virtual models of sites, landscapes, and artifacts offer new ways to engage with archaeological evidence. The authors explore the conceptual and methodological affordances provided by virtual reconstruction, positioning it as a valuable tool in both research and education.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at archaeologists, digital heritage professionals, and researchers interested in how virtual reconstruction can reshape archaeological practices. It is particularly relevant for those focused on landscape archaeology and the digital representation of archaeological sites.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: The Role of Virtual Reconstruction
2. Affordances of Digital Landscapes and Sites
3. Case Studies: Virtual Reconstruction in Practice
4. Implications for Archaeological Interpretation
5. Conclusion: Embracing Digital Methods in Archaeology

## Key Excerpt

"Virtual reconstructions allow archaeologists to visualize and interpret landscapes in ways that are not possible with traditional methods. These models create new opportunities for observation and analysis, bridging the gap between physical sites and digital representations."
