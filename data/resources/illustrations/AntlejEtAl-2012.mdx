## Abstract

This article presents a case study on the restoration of a stemmed fruit bowl using 3D technologies. Authored by Kristina Antlej, Klavdija Celec, Merita Sinani, Edvard Mirtič, and Dražen Ljubič, the paper outlines the use of 3D scanning, modeling, and printing in the process of reconstructing the damaged bowl. Published in _Преглед НЦД_, the study demonstrates how digital technologies can contribute to the restoration and preservation of delicate cultural heritage objects.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at conservators, digital heritage professionals, and archaeologists interested in applying 3D technologies to the restoration and preservation of cultural heritage artifacts. It provides practical insights into the benefits and challenges of using digital tools for artifact reconstruction.
