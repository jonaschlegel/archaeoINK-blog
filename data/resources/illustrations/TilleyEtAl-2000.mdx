## Abstract

In this article, Tilley, Hamilton, and Bender explore the conceptual links between creating contemporary environmental art and interpreting prehistoric landscapes, using their research at Leskernick Hill, Bodmin Moor. By integrating installation art and archaeological methods, the authors examine how art can enrich our understanding of place, using techniques like stone wrapping, visual framing, and horizon mapping to re-engage with the prehistoric landscape. They argue that these art practices offer a means of re-presenting the past in the present, deepening the relationship between archaeological findings and human interaction with landscape.

## Purpose and Audience

The article is directed at archaeologists, artists, and anthropologists interested in interdisciplinary approaches to landscape interpretation. It aims to show how art installations can support a phenomenological approach to archaeology, where sensory engagement with the landscape serves as a means of understanding prehistoric cultural practices.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction: Art and Archaeology
2. The Leskernick Project: A Dialectic Approach
3. Environmental Art and Landscape Interaction
4. Installation Techniques: Stone Wrapping, Framing, and Horizon Mapping
5. Conclusion: Dialectics of Past and Present

## Key Excerpt

"We conceive of the role of art in the Leskernick project as a means to renegotiate a relationship with the past from which we have become alienated. We work in an unpopulated village that has been abandoned for over 2,500 years... Art is a means by which we can give expression to the particularity of place." (p. 45)

## Difficulty Level

Advanced – The article assumes familiarity with archaeological theory, phenomenology, and contemporary environmental art.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

The work is highly relevant for archaeologists interested in integrating sensory, artistic methods into their fieldwork. It offers a framework for using art to interpret landscapes in ways that go beyond empirical data, making it valuable for researchers in interpretative and phenomenological archaeology.

## Benefits of the Resource

- **Innovative Approach**: The authors’ interdisciplinary framework opens up new possibilities for experiencing and representing archaeological sites.
- **Emphasis on Sensory Engagement**: The article highlights methods that encourage archaeologists to engage with the landscape through their senses.
- **Inspiration from Contemporary Art**: Tilley, Hamilton, and Bender draw from the techniques of environmental artists to create dynamic interactions with prehistoric sites.

## Limitations of the Resource

- **Subjective Interpretation**: The approach may be too interpretative for archaeologists focused on empirical and quantitative methods.
- **Resource-Intensive**: The methods described, such as large-scale installation and continuous field presence, require considerable resources and may be difficult to replicate in smaller projects.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The article includes descriptive accounts of the Leskernick installations, such as the stone wrapping, spoil heap sculpting, and horizon silhouettes, but lacks step-by-step exercises for practical application.

## Reviews
