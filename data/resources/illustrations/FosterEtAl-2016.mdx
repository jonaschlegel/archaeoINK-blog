Published in the "European Journal of Archaeology", the article discusses how replicas can serve as proxies for original objects, allowing for both public engagement and the preservation of fragile artifacts. The authors emphasize the ongoing relevance of replicas in the digital age, where 3D printing and virtual replicas are becoming increasingly common.
