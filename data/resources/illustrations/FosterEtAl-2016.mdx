## Abstract

This article by Sally Foster and Neil Curtis explores the significance of historic replicas in archaeology and museums, arguing that replicas play a crucial role in cultural heritage preservation and interpretation. Published in the _European Journal of Archaeology_, the article discusses how replicas can serve as proxies for original objects, allowing for both public engagement and the preservation of fragile artifacts. The authors emphasize the ongoing relevance of replicas in the digital age, where 3D printing and virtual replicas are becoming increasingly common.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is intended for archaeologists, museum professionals, and cultural heritage practitioners interested in the role of replicas in preserving and interpreting historical artifacts. It offers a theoretical and practical discussion on why replicas matter in the context of both physical and digital reproduction.
