## Abstract

In this article, E. L. Sterud and Arne Bohlin introduce a technique that combines photography with line drawing for illustrating small finds in archaeological contexts. Published in the _Journal of Field Archaeology_, the authors describe how integrating both photographic and drawn elements can improve the accuracy and clarity of small-find illustrations, making them more useful for both research and publication. The method provides a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of each technique to better convey detailed information about artifacts.

## Purpose and Audience

This article is aimed at archaeologists, illustrators, and researchers interested in improving the accuracy and utility of small-find illustrations. The combined technique is particularly valuable for those working with delicate or complex artifacts that require both visual realism and interpretive clarity.

## Key Excerpt

"Combining photography with line drawing offers the best of both worlds: the precision and detail of a photograph, and the clarity and focus of a hand-drawn illustration. This hybrid technique allows for more effective communication of the artifact’s key features, which can often be lost in one medium alone."
