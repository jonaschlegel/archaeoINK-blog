6. Digital and Manual Integration for Publication

## Key Excerpt

> “Illustrating prehistoric pottery is about accurately capturing surface decoration and form, which can inform understanding of ancient technologies and aesthetics.” (p. 3)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate to Advanced. The guide requires some knowledge of archaeological drawing but explains techniques in sufficient detail for illustrators to develop or refine their skills.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

This guide is highly relevant for archaeological documentation of prehistoric pottery, offering standardised approaches for handling incomplete or highly decorated artefacts. It is suitable for use in field, museum, and publication settings.

## Benefits of the Resource

The guide provides focused instruction on prehistoric pottery, a category often requiring specialised techniques. Its attention to both surface detail and form aids in creating high-quality illustrations that support comparative and interpretative research in archaeology.

## Limitations of the Resource

The guide is specific to prehistoric pottery and does not cover other artefact types or advanced digital tools, which some illustrators may find limiting.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The guide includes practical advice and illustrative steps but lacks formal exercises. It covers specific techniques for illustrating common types of prehistoric pottery decorations and structures.

## Reviews

This guide is highly valued within the archaeological community, particularly among those specialising in prehistoric artefacts, for its detailed approach to documenting pottery in a way that supports academic and field research.
