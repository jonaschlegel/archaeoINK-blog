## Abstract

This guide provides a specialised approach to illustrating wooden artefacts within archaeological contexts, addressing unique considerations such as wood grain, structure, and preservation state. Alan J. Wood covers essential techniques for accurately documenting artefact morphology, while maintaining the conventions that aid in the clear depiction and analysis of wooden artefacts in publications. Intended for archaeological illustrators, the guide standardises drawing practices and integrates options for using traditional and digital methods.

## Purpose and Audience

The guide serves illustrators, archaeologists, and students working with wooden artefacts, particularly those responsible for producing accurate, publishable illustrations. It’s aimed at both professionals and beginners in archaeological illustration, focusing on techniques specific to wood to facilitate comparability in artefact documentation.

## Table of Contents

1. Introduction
2. Tools and Materials
3. Wood Characteristics and Representation
4. Techniques for Drawing Wood Grain
5. Complex Forms and Fragmented Artefacts
6. Preparing Drawings for Publication

## Key Excerpt

“The primary goal in illustrating wooden artefacts is to capture the form, structure, and grain accurately, allowing for a clearer understanding of construction methods and usage.” (p. 2)

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate. While introductory in style, the focus on wood-specific techniques makes it suitable for those with a foundational understanding of archaeological illustration.

## Practicality/ Field Relevance

The guide is highly relevant for archaeological documentation, specifically tailored to artefacts made from wood, a material with unique preservation challenges. It provides guidance on the nuances of capturing wood grain and artefact wear, essential for accurate publication-ready illustrations.

## Benefits of the Resource

Its dedicated focus on wooden artefacts fills a niche in archaeological illustration, providing methods that are often not covered in general artefact illustration guides. The technical advice on showing grain and structure is particularly useful for professional standardisation.

## Limitations of the Resource

The guide is specific to wooden artefacts, so its applicability is limited to wood rather than artefacts of other materials. Additionally, it focuses primarily on manual illustration techniques, with minimal emphasis on advanced digital tools.

## Practical Exercises or Case Studies Included

The guide includes practical instructions for illustrating wood grain and complex forms, though formal exercises are not provided. Its detailed approach makes it useful for hands-on learning.

## Reviews

The Illustration of Wooden Artefacts" is a respected resource within archaeological illustration, valued for its specialised focus on wood-specific techniques.
