summary: 'The #100DaysOfDrawing challenge encourages archaeologists to draw daily for 100 days, enhancing both technical illustration skills and deeper engagement with archaeological materials. It highlights the value of consistent practice, fostering a supportive community that shares insights and techniques while appreciating the nuances of ancient craftsmanship. This challenge transforms drawing into an educational tool that bridges the gap between observation and a profound understanding of artefacts.'

The #100DaysOfDrawing challenge is an initiative born from the spirit of the #100DaysOfCode movement, which was established to build communities around consistent daily practices. Taking inspiration from _Alexander Kallaway’s 2016_ introduction of #100DaysOfCode, this archaeological adaptation serves not only as a platform for developing illustration skills but also as a means of engaging deeply with our archaeological heritage. The original coding challenge emphasized daily discipline and a collective environment for skill enhancement, which I also talked about in my [Learn in Public blog post](https://www.archaeoink.com/blog/learn-in-public), a model that resonates profoundly with archaeological illustration.

The #100DaysOfDrawing initiative calls upon participants to commit to drawing every day for 100 days, focusing on artefacts and archaeological subjects. This process encourages consistency and reinforces the value of shared learning within a community. By sharing drawings on social media under the #100DaysOfDrawing hashtag, participants can foster connections with others, creating a space where the technical aspects of archaeological illustration are discussed and appreciated. Emphasizing scientific accuracy and allowing room for flexibility if a day is missed, the challenge promotes communal engagement rather than competitive pressure. The connection to archaeological practice lies in the meticulous observation required for accurate illustration, where participants enrich their understanding of the past through continuous, focused engagement.

Drawing as a practice has always held significance in archaeology, serving as a method for documenting artefacts with an unparalleled level of precision. Sarah Andersen’s comic strip (**Figure 1**), depicting the evolution of drawing skills through practice, humorously underscores the importance of consistency in skill development. The humor here is a stark reminder that even the most proficient archaeologists and illustrators started somewhere, and consistent practice remains an undeniable key to growth. The act of drawing, whether as a student or a seasoned professional, demands a precise observation of form, texture, and craftsmanship, encouraging us to view our subjects with a greater sense of appreciation and understanding.

Such careful attention to detail allows us to uncover minute features often missed by the untrained eye. This enhanced observational capacity can be transformative, shaping how we interpret artefacts. In this sense, drawing does not simply replicate; it actively engages with the past, offering fresh perspectives on ancient materials and processes. The potential for drawing as an educational tool is reinforced by studies like that of Lyon et al. (2016), which explored the impact of collaborative drawing courses across various disciplines, such as craft and medicine. Their findings revealed how drawing cultivates a heightened sense of observation and understanding, a principle that holds true within the realm of archaeology as well. The study revealed that students’ perceptions shifted as they began to understand drawing as an integral part of learning rather than a mere artistic endeavour. Such cross-disciplinary insights emphasize the value of integrating drawing into archaeological education.

Engaging with different materials through illustration also provides a unique educational experience. My own journey through the #100DaysOfDrawing challenge has revealed this in unexpected ways. Over the first 22 days, I have experimented with various techniques, particularly stippling, which involves using countless small dots to create texture and form. Using a Micron 0.05 pen, I worked on a copper alloy axe head, a task requiring immense patience. The process of stippling forces one to examine every curve and indentation with a discerning eye. Despite the challenges, the satisfaction of seeing the artefact come to life on paper is undeniable. Working with decayed materials like metals, wood, and leather has proven especially intriguing, as the imperfect textures lend themselves to a rewarding visual representation (Figure 2). Such exercises underscore the complexities of artefacts and deepen one’s appreciation for their craftsmanship.

Flint, on the other hand, presents a different kind of challenge. Its sharp, irregular shapes and the play of light on its surfaces require an entirely different observational and illustrative approach. Here, drawing becomes an exercise in problem-solving, as capturing the reflective qualities of stone necessitates innovative techniques. Each material thus becomes an educational subject, each drawing a small case study in archaeological research. These experiences highlight how drawing sharpens our ‘looking’ skills, transforming the way we approach artefacts. The drawing process acts as a bridge between observation and understanding, prompting us to consider details we might have otherwise overlooked.

The communal aspect of the #100DaysOfDrawing challenge, though not a formal requirement, has also proven essential. Participants share their work, comment on each other’s techniques, and provide encouragement, creating a supportive environment that enriches the overall experience. This informal collaboration echoes the findings of Lyon et al. (2016), where the communal aspect of drawing courses led to significant educational benefits. In the same way, sharing work online invites discussion, reflection, and feedback, fostering a collective appreciation for archaeological illustration. The global reach of social media platforms ensures that even those working in isolation can feel connected to a broader community.

Reaching day 22 of this challenge has already shaped my routine, balancing technical skill development with a deeper understanding of archaeological subjects. Drawing artefacts daily has become more than just an exercise in precision; it has become a way to connect with our shared past. The repetitive, focused act of illustrating artefacts reveals stories embedded within the materials, from the way a bronze axe head has patinated over centuries to the preserved grain of a wooden tool. The knowledge gained through this meticulous work informs not only my artistic practice but also my archaeological understanding.

Looking ahead, the challenge continues to offer opportunities for growth and exploration. New materials, artefact types, and drawing techniques lie in wait, promising further insights and discoveries. As I refine my prompt list, suggestions from the community are invaluable, broadening the scope of our collective exploration. For those interested in joining this journey, I have prepared a set of prompts for the first 25 days (**Figure 3**), focusing on a variety of archaeological materials. Engaging with these prompts and sharing your progress could spark meaningful dialogue, enriching our collective knowledge.

The #100DaysOfDrawing challenge serves as a reminder of the educational power of drawing within archaeology. It emphasizes the value of consistency and community, transforming an artistic endeavour into a tool for deeper understanding. By drawing daily, we not only improve our skills but also connect with the past in meaningful ways. Each illustration becomes a conversation with history, a way to uncover and appreciate the nuances of ancient craftsmanship. The journey is ongoing, and the discoveries are endless. In sharing our drawings, we contribute to a wider dialogue, learning from one another and building a community that appreciates the past through a shared creative lens.

The #100DaysOfDrawing challenge is more than a means of skill development; it is a bridge to a richer understanding of our archaeological heritage. As this journey continues, I invite you to share your thoughts and illustrations, contributing to a collective appreciation of history. Let us draw, observe, and learn together, each day adding a new chapter to the story of the past.
