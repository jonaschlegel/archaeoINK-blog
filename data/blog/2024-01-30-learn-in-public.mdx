# Navigating 'Learn in Public'

In today’s interconnected and more and more digital world, the concept of 'Learn in Public' can be seen as a compelling strategy for those looking to navigate their professional development with openness and community support, especially starting their journey off. This concept is there to encourage individuals to share their learnings openly, embracing both the milestones achieved and the obstacles encountered along the way. While Shawn Wang has been instrumental in popularizing this concept within the tech community, its roots extend across various disciplines, underscoring the universal value of transparent knowledge sharing (Wang, 2018).

The basics of 'Learn in Public' are lying in the general simplicity and also the ability to create a relationship between the learner, their community and potential future mentors. By documenting the learning progress, challenges, and insights, individuals not only contribute to their own growth but they furthermore provide more knowledge and exchange to the learning ecosystem they are a part of. This process fosters a supportive network where feedback and collaboration genuinely advance personal and professional development. Although the practice has seen its most notable application within the realms of technology and web development, its principles are readily adaptable to other fields. From beauty influencers on YouTube to developers on GitHub, the concept has demonstrated its versatility and effectiveness in fostering growth and building networks (Scarlett, 2022; Omi, 2020). Each story of learning shared publicly serves as both inspiration and a resource, creating a rich tapestry of knowledge that benefits the entire community.

However, embracing 'Learn in Public' is not without its challenges. Concerns over judgment, the fear of sharing imperfect work, and the potential for misinformation are obstacles that many face. Yet, the journey of learning in public also offers valuable lessons in vulnerability, resilience, and the power of community support. It encourages individuals to break free from the isolation of solitary learning, stepping into a world where growth is a shared endeavour and where every mistake is an opportunity for communal learning. By exploring these narratives and ideas in this blog post, I hope to uncover how the concept of 'Learn in Public' can be applied in new and innovative ways, enriching not just our professional lives but also creating a more connected and supportive learning ecosystem for myself here and especially also on Instagram.

## Choosing the Right Platform

When embarking on a 'Learn in Public' journey, one of the first decisions to make involves selecting the right platform to share your learning journey. This is an important choice as it should play to the learners strengths and is influence by the community that could be build, the type of feedback received, and the overall visibility of the journey ahead. The digital landscape offers a manyfold of platforms, each with unique features and audiences, making it essential to consider where your contributions will be most valued and impactful. Here are some platforms and the reasons of why to chose them:

- YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and maybe also Discord: Ideal for those who prefer video content, these platforms allow for in-depth tutorials, live coding sessions, or real-time discussions. While they offer extensive reach and the potential for engaging content, the production of videos requires significant time and resources.

- X (formerly known as Twitter), Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon: These microblogging platforms are excellent for quick updates, sharing links to resources, or joining conversations through hashtags like #LearnInPublic. They facilitate immediate engagement but can be limited by character count or the fleeting nature of content visibility.

- Instagram and maybe Snapchat: These visual platforms are great for sharing snapshots of your learning process, infographics, or short videos. The visual nature can enhance engagement, but the platforms are more suited to visual and less to text-heavy content.

- Blogs, Medium and Newsletters: Provide a space for detailed exploration of topics, reflections on the learning process, and curated content delivered directly to readers. The main struggle here is building an initial subscriber base and maintaining consistent content output.

Expanding on the choice of platforms, it's important to address the evolution of tools that have supported 'Learn in Public'. The "Learn in Public Bot" on X, developed by @sumdook, played a crucial role in amplifying the movement by engaging with content tagged #LearnInPublic. This bot, along with others, faced a significant setback due to the cessation of free API access on X in May 2023, as reported by The Verge and Techdirt. This restriction led to a decline in small-scale, community-oriented bots, impacting the online communities that flourished with their support (The Verge, 2024; Techdirt, 2024).

Despite these changes, the spirit of #LearnInPublic continues to thrive. Platforms like Mastodon have become new hubs for sharing and engagement under the #LearnInPublic tag. Instagram remains a vibrant platform for documenting learning journeys visually. These shifts underscore the resilience of learning cultures online and the adaptability of communities in the face of changing digital landscapes. They remind us that the essence of learning and sharing transcends the platforms we use, persisting even as the tools and mediums evolve.

## Overcoming the Hurdles of 'Learn in Public'

While the benefits of 'Learn in Public' are manifold, individuals often encounter a set of common fears and misconceptions that can hinder to share the learning journey online. Drawing from the insights shared by Rizèl Scarlett, this section aims to address these concerns, offering perspectives to help mitigate these fears (Scarlett, 2022).

### The Fear of Judgment and Imperfection

One of the most pervasive fears is the apprehension about judgment from peers or the broader community. Many hesitate to share their work publicly due to a fear of exposing their imperfections or being criticized for their lack of expertise. However, 'Learn in Public' thrives on the principle of growth through vulnerability. By sharing your learning process, including the missteps and uncertainties, you invite constructive feedback that can accelerate your development. Moreover, this openness fosters a supportive environment where others feel encouraged to share their journeys, contributing to a culture of collective learning and empathy.

### The Risk of Misinformation

Another concern revolves around the potential to spread misinformation inadvertently. While the intent of 'Learn in Public' is to share knowledge and experiences, there's a responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the information being disseminated. It's crucial to approach public learning with a mindset of humility, ready to correct mistakes and learn from them. Engaging in 'Learn in Public' doesn't require you to be an expert but to be a dedicated learner who values accuracy and is willing to update or correct shared information as new insights are gained.

### Navigating Online Trolls and Negative Feedback

The online world, unfortunately, includes its share of trolls and unwarranted negativity. The prospect of facing such feedback can be daunting. However, focusing on the constructive and supportive elements of the community can outweigh the negativity. Building a network of learners and mentors who provide positive reinforcement and constructive criticism can create a buffer against the less productive aspects of online engagement. Remember, the majority of the community is invested in mutual growth and support.

## How to Effectively Engage in 'Learn in Public'

- Start Posting: Begin with small, manageable posts. Share a finding, a snippet of what you're learning, or a question you're pondering.

- Learn from Others and Interact: Make it a routine to comment on and interact with others' posts. Offer support, share your insights, or ask questions to deepen your understanding.

- Reflect on Your Progress: Set aside time each month to review what you've learned and shared. Use a simple tool like a digital journal or blog for reflection.

- Celebrate Your Wins and Learnings: Acknowledge every milestone, big or small. Share your successes and challenges openly, focusing on what each experience taught you.

- Start again: Continue the cycle of posting, interacting, reflecting, and celebrating. Keep the momentum going with regular, consistent engagement.

By following these simplified and actionable steps, you can more easily integrate the 'Learn in Public' approach into your daily routine, making the process of sharing your learning journey both rewarding and sustainable.
