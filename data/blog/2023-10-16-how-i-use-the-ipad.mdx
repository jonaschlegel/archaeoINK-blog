The iPad, often perceived as a gadget, has carved a niche generally but also within archaeology, especially fieldwork. My engagement with this device started in the beginning of 2021, whereby I am focussing especially to use modern technology and take it onto ancient narratives and archaeological illustrations. The portable and user-friendly nature of iPads, coupled with their robust suite of applications, has generally facilitated a more dynamic and efficient mode for me in my archaeological practice.

Initially, the iPad served me primary as a digital notebook, and recording my thoughts and insights on scientific articles. The transition from paper to digital notes was quite smoothly, and enabled me to enhance the efficiency of information collection and retrieval. From that point on, this digital tool soon grow into a medium for crafting archaeological illustrations, visually exploring any archaeological concepts, sub-fields and topics. These illustrations thereby quickly evolved into explanatory tools, fostering a better understanding and communication of archaeological themes, which can be found on my Instagram account [archaeoINK](https://www.instagram.com/archaeoink/).

My exploration in using the iPad Pro got further with the discovery of the [3D Scanner App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-app/id1419913995), [Polycam](https://apps.apple.com/at/app/polycam-lidar-3d-scanner/id1532482376) and similar applications. These apps allowed me to capture 3D models of statues and various objects that piqued interest, documenting their form and intricacies. The ease of creating 3D representations unveiled a fresh perspective on documenting objects that were historically significant and aesthetically captivating. The apps in connection to the iPad were easy to use and the 3D models were really quickly generated. The only problem was the knowledge if the model follows an exact scale or orientation, even though measuring is possible in the apps mentioned above.

With these application in my bag, my journey and experiences with the iPad extended to archaeological excavations, where utilised the 3D scanner app for documenting archaeological features and layers quite easily. Generating 3D models with theses tools is due to the integrated Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in the iPad. This technology measures distances using laser light to generate precise 3D models of the surroundings. The initiation of LiDAR in Apple devices began with the release of the iPad Pro in 2020 and the iPhone 12 Pro, rendering 3D scanning more accessible. For a detailed understanding of LiDAR technology, readers might find the explanation by Apple insightful (Apple, 2022).

Overall, the texture and geometries captured in the 3D models facilitated quicker drafting of the excavation processes, offering a visual aid in understanding the unfolding archaeological narrative. But still it is to say, that this setup does not feel like it can compare to the accuracy and details of a [terrestrial laser scanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_scanning) (TLS) or [image-based modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_modeling_and_rendering) (IBM), which are both methods commonly used in the documentation of excavation processes and findings. So, in regards to 3D modelling, the iPad can be seen as a tool which emerged for capturing interim steps, structuring interpretations and ideas swiftly. Yet, for a final documentation, the tried-and-tested methods like TLS and IBM continued to hold their ground as solid documentation methods.

Within the broader archaeological landscape, the adoption of modern gadgets like the iPad can positively influencing the documentation processes especially in regards to field work. I use an outdoor like cover and take notes on the process as well as taking sketches based on the 3D scanner app results, which overall contributes to the practicises of digitising archaeological processes. So, under this lense the iPad represents a pragmatic step forward. However, certain aspects like the costs, accuracy, and the learning curve of handling a new device render the iPad not the first choice of equipment for some. I will continue to utilise my iPad and eagerly anticipate the updates that the device will receive in the future, and explore the applications of the iPad in archaeology.
