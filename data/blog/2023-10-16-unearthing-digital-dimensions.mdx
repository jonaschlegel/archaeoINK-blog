The iPad, often perceived as a daily-use gadget, has carved a niche within diverse archaeological toolkits. My productive engagement with this device commenced early in 2021, heralding the confluence of modern technology with ancient narratives and archaeological elucidations. The portable and user-friendly nature of iPads, coupled with their robust suite of applications, has facilitated a more dynamic and efficient mode for me in my archaeological practice.

Initially, the iPad served as a digital notebook for me, facilitating the recording of insights from scientific articles. The transition from paper to digital notes unfolded smoothly, enhancing the efficiency of information collection and retrieval. This digital companion soon evolved into a medium for crafting archaeological illustrations, visually demystifying complex archaeological concepts. These illustrations metamorphosed into explanatory tools, fostering a better understanding and communication of archaeological themes.

The exploration advanced with the discovery of the 3D Scanner App on the iPad Pro 12.9 2020. The device's portability rendered it a constant companion on numerous outings. It was employed to capture 3D models of statues and various objects that piqued interest, documenting their form and intricacies. The ease of creating 3D representations unveiled a fresh perspective on documenting objects that were historically significant and aesthetically captivating.

The journey extended to archaeological excavations, where the iPad played a pivotal role in documenting archaeological features and layers swiftly. Utilising the 3D scanner app alleviated the daily documentation workload, making it more efficient. The texture details captured in the 3D models facilitated quicker drafting of the excavation processes, offering a visual aid in understanding the unfolding archaeological narrative.

However, the integration of the iPad did not supplant established documentation methods. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and image-based modelling (IBM) remained paramount for documenting each stratigraphic unit comprehensively. The iPad emerged as a tool for capturing interim steps, structuring interpretations and ideas swiftly. Yet, for a final documentation, the tried-and-tested methods like TLS and IBM continued to hold their ground as solid documentation methods.

The Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in the iPad warrants a mention. Integrated into the device, this technology measures distances using laser light to generate precise 3D models of the surroundings. The initiation of LiDAR in Apple devices began with the release of the iPad Pro in 2020 and the iPhone 12 Pro, rendering 3D scanning more accessible. For a detailed understanding of LiDAR technology, readers might find the explanation by Apple insightful (Apple, 2022).

Within the broader archaeological landscape, the adoption of modern gadgets like the iPad is positively influencing methodologies. It potentially fosters more collaborative efforts among archaeologists and possibly enhances public engagement with historical sites. However, challenges such as the cost of the device and the line-of-sight requirement of the LiDAR sensor provide a balanced view of this technological integration. This balanced perspective is crucial in understanding the scope and limitations of modern tech in the field of archaeology.

The incorporation of the iPad into archaeological practices transcends a mere futuristic allure and represents a pragmatic step forward. However, certain aspects like the costs, accuracy, and the learning curve of handling a new device render the iPad not the first choice of equipment for some. I will continue to utilise my iPad and eagerly anticipate the updates that the device will receive in the future, optimistically contributing to the digitisation of archaeological practices.
