For me the combination of art and science opens up exciting new directions for exploration in the waste field of archaeology. One example for such a possibility to not only use artistic aspects in archaeology but also incorporate scientific communication, is the yearly repeating drawing challenge #archInk, an initiative that fuses archaeological topics with the craft of (ink) drawings. This quite creative venture stems from Inktober, which is a worldwide art challenge started in 2009 by Jake Parker. Originally aimed at improving his own drawing skills, Inktober has since inspired artists globally to create ink drawings every day in October _Parker 2023_ and share their works every day on social media platforms - especially Instagram. Just as "Inktober" melds "ink" with "October," #archInk cleverly combines "archaeology" and "ink" into a single term. Like Inktober, #archInk also takes place every October with daily drawing prompts.

## The Origins of #archInk

Dr. Katherine Cook, an archaeologist at the University of Montreal, Canada, started #archInk in 2018. She designed it as a fun and educational way to spark creativity and fresh thinking in archaeology and anthropology students - mainly for a course that she ran. _Cook 2018_ outlines the foundational principles of #archInk in her blog post, highlighting how it boosts creative communication and sharpens critical thinking skills. Not only seem the contributions during #archInk a challenge for the participants to advance in their artistic skills but also challenging the selected prompts and the other attendees.

#### My Personal Experience with #archInk

Jumping into #archInk was like exploring a new world. Back in October 2020, I took part in that challenge for the first time, mainly with the idea of advancing in my drawing skills with pen and paper but also to connect with archaeologists who are also exploring art. Every now and then, I also mixed in some watercolour paint just for the splash of colour.
The 2020 prompt list and the work of fellow participants pushed me to think outside the box. The experience challenged me to bring each #archInk theme to life in my own unique way, sparking a deeper interest in the intersection of art and archaeology. Fast forward to 2021, and because I brought myself an iPad that year. This shift to digital art opened up a whole new playground for me. My digital drawings from October 2021, mostly in strong black lines, offered a new approach for me and helped me level up my (digital) art. Now, with October 2023 just around the bend, I'm ready again to dive back into the #archInk experience.

## #archInk and SciCom

The role of art in science communication, often also shortened to SciCom [link to my blog post on SciCom and SciComm](/blog/science-communication-vs-scientific-communication), is getting the focus it deserves via #archInk. Take the article by _Gonzalez et al. 2021_, for example: they talked to artists in a travelling science museum and found that art does more than just look pretty but it furthermore sparks dialogue, challenges the way we think, and even changes how we feel about knowledge. This research shows that these travelling art projects can make science accessible to everyone, no matter where they are. Also _Curtis et al. 2012_ make a similar point. They say that adding a little bit of art to scientific events can make the whole experience more engaging. It gets people to think about new ways to talk about science, which is always a good thing.

So, what does this mean for #archInk? It seems like it enable new ways to talk about archaeology on social media platforms. When you draw something for #archInk, you're not just making art; you're exploring the world of archaeology in a whole new way. And thanks to hashtags like #archInk on X (former Twitter) and Instagram, everyone can share their creations and learn from each other. But #archInk should not just be for October. If you're itching to get your hands dirty with some ink and archaeology, why wait? You can join #Inktober52, which runs all year and gives you a new theme every week _Parker 2023_. So, you can keep those creative skills flowing and maybe even come up with your own archaeological themes to explore. To see what I'm up to, give me a follow at @archaeoINK on Instagram. I am already sharing my own blend of art and archaeology not regular on my Instagram account to engage with archaeologists and the public on archaeological topics, and I can't wait to see what you'll bring to the table. So, also share your works starting on the first of October 2023 with the hashtag #archInk
