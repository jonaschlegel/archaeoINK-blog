# Welcome to archaeoINK

Hello and welcome! I'm Jona, the person behind archaeoINK. This blog is my platform for 'Learning in Public'â€”a space where I share my journey, thoughts, and discoveries across a spectrum of interests that intersect archaeology, technology, and scientific communication.

My background in archaeology and my ventures into web design, graphic software, and geophysical prospecting have shaped a unique perspective. Here, I delve into topics ranging from data organisation systems and software tools to personal knowledge management using applications like Obsidian, Notion, and Capacities.

## Topics to cover

This blog generally will not really cover archaeological sites or periods or artifacts or findings. It's more about the concepts that underpin our understanding of the past, and how I see and understand them:

- How we collect and organise data in archaeology.
- Methods of presenting archaeological knowledge to the public and fellow researchers.
- Addressing biases within archaeology and striving for a more inclusive understanding of history.

Furthermore, expect discussions on:

- Definitions and explanations of key concepts and terms in archaeology and related fields.
- Insights into knowledge organisation systems, including the use of graph databases and ontologies like CIDOC CRM.
- The art and science of creating effective illustrations for museums, exhibitions, and scientific publications.
- Approaches to enhancing scientific communication within the archaeological community and to the public.

This blog is also a platform for sharing knowledge and engaging with like-minded enthusiasts and professionals. Whether you're an archaeology student, a fellow artist, or simply someone fascinated by the past. Your thoughts and perspectives are invaluable. I encourage you to engage, share your views, and be part of a collaborative learning experience.
